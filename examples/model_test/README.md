## Model Test Harness

A front-end for assembling and debugging models.

The primary use-case is loading model configurations with the "Custom Model Notebook" to ensure that a new configuration can actually complete a forward and backward pass, before training an instance of the model.

There are also tools in the notebook for model profiling.
