## The root directories from which to compute the locations of other directories.
## This file is common to both config and meta-config templates.

## The following absolute locations are available, as starting points:
## project_dir : The location of the project directory
## workspace_root : The location of the workspace-root directory.
## forgather_config_dir() : The user's Forgather configuration directory
##    On Linux, this is "~/.config/forgather"
## user_home_dir() : The location of the user's home directory (~ on Linux).

## Where is Forgather located?
## For external workspaces, this points to the installed Forgather location
-- set ns.forgather_dir = "/home/dinalt/ai_assets/forgather"

## Additional user-defined locations should be added here.
## Examples:
-- set ns.ai_assets_dir = "/home/dinalt/ai_assets"
-- set ns.user_projects_dir = "/home/dinalt/claudes_model"
