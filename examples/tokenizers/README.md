# Tokenizer Examples

This directory contains examples of different tokenizer configurations and usage patterns in Forgather.

## Projects

### tokenizer_comparison/
Demonstrates how to compare different tokenizer implementations and their effects on model training. This project shows how to configure and evaluate various tokenizer types within the Forgather framework.

## Usage

cd tokenizer_comparison
forgather ls
forgather -t [config_name].yaml pp
```

Each tokenizer configuration can be explored and tested independently to understand their behavior and performance characteristics.
