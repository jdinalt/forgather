       "In this tutorial we will train a very small Llama model (about 5M parameters) on 10% of the Tiny Stories dataset. On a single RTX-4090, this takes about three minutes. Once training is complete, we will load the model an use it for text generation -- and the generation will be reasonably coherent for a three-minute-old model.\n",
