## The root directories from which to compute the locations of other directories.
## This file is common to both config and meta-config templates.
## In projects, it would be included in the 'base_directories' template block. i.e.
## -- block base_directories
##    -- include 'base_directories.yaml'
## -- endblock base_directories

## The following abolute locations are available, as starting points:
## project_dir : The location of the project directory
## workspace_root : The location of the workspace-root directory.
## forgather_config_dir() : The user's Forgather configuration directory
##    On Linux, this is "~/.config/forgather"
## user_home_dir() : The location of the user's home directory (~ on Linux).

## Where is Forgather located?
## As this is the config for Forgather, Forgather is located at the workspace_root
## For user-defined workspaces, this would be wherever you have installed Forgather.
-- set ns.forgather_dir = joinpath(workspace_root, "..", "..")

## Additional user-defined locations should be added here.
## Examples:
## -- set ns.ai_assets_dir = joinpath(user_home_dir(), "ai_assets")
## -- set ns.user_projects_dir = joinpath(ns.ai_assets_dir, 'projects')
