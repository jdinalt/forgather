class LRSchedulersContainer(Stateful):
    """Container for multiple learning rate schedulers.

    Modified from original to take a factory (a partial function) to construct
    lr-scheduler instances, rather than using LambdaLR.

    This class is used to wrap multiple LRSchedulers into a single object that can be
    used to reduce the complexity of the training loop. This mimics the behavior of
    ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler``. The design concept is the same as
    ``OptimizersContainer``. This class currently only supports ``LambdaLR``.

    **Note**
    Users who want to customize the lr_scheduler behavior can inherit from this class and
    extend the functionality as needed. The following methods must follow the same
    signature as ``torch.optim.lr_scheduler.LRScheduler`` class: ``step()``, ``state_dict()``,
    ``load_state_dict()``.

    **Limitations**
    This class assumes all the lr schedulers are the same. There is no easy way to support
    resharding for multiple different LRSchedulers because LRScheduler.state_dict() is not
    resharding friendly. Therefore, the limitation is used to allow TorchTitan to support
    lr scheduler resharding.

        optimizers (OptimizersContainer): The corresponding optimizers for the lr_schedulers.
        lr_scheduler_factory: Partial function for constructing LR scheduler
