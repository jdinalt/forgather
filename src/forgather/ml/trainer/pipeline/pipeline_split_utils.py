    Programmatically generates module names per model part for LLM models.

    This function distributes the model components across pipeline stages,
    treating the input encoder and output decoder with configurable weights
    to account for their computational cost relative to transformer layers.

    Args:
        num_stages: Number of pipeline stages
        num_layers: Total number of transformer layers in the model
        input_weight: Weight for input modules (input_encoder) in layer calculation
        output_weight: Weight for output modules (layer_norm + output_decoder) in layer calculation

    Returns:
        List of lists containing module names for each model part.

        - "input_encoder" for token embeddings + positional encoding
        - "layer_stack.layers.0", "layer_stack.layers.1", ... for transformer layers
        - "layer_stack.layer_norm" for final normalization
        - "output_decoder" for the output projection layer
