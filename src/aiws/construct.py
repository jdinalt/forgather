    """
    Register an object as a HF AutoClass

    PretrainedModel and PretrainedConfig both support this method. When applied,
    the source code for the respective objects will be automatically saved
    with the model weights.

    This is very useful for custom models, as it simplifies things if the code is
    stored with the model.

    The following macro demonstrates how it can be used in a configuration script.
    ```
    ## Custom model constructor
    ## Defines a constructor for a custom model and registers both the
    ## configuration and model class for AutoConfig/AutoModel construction.
    -- macro custom_model(model_path, model_cls, config_cls, model_config)
    !object:aiws.construct:register_for_auto_class
        - !object:{{model_path}}:{{model_cls}}
            - !object:aiws.construct:register_for_auto_class
                - !object:{{model_path}}:{{config_cls}}
                    kwargs: *{{model_config}}
