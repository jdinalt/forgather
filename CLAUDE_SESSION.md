# Claude Session Context for Forgather Project

**Instructions for User**: At the start of new conversations, tell Claude: "Please read CLAUDE_SESSION.md to understand the current project context and your previous learnings."

**Last Updated**: 2025-06-23 (after implementing checkpoint functionality)

## Project Overview
Forgather is a configuration-driven ML framework built on template inheritance and code generation. The core abstraction is the **Project**, which encapsulates ML experiments through a sophisticated template system.

### Key Architecture Insights Learned
- **Template System**: Uses Jinja2 preprocessing with custom line statements (`-- extends`, `-- block`, `-- endblock`)
- **Inheritance Chains**: Complex template inheritance can cause configuration overrides (e.g., `train.yaml → project.yaml → projects/tiny.yaml → types/training_script/causal_lm/causal_lm.yaml`)
- **Configuration Loading**: Use `proj("component_name")` to extract specific components, `proj.environment.load("path")` to load templates
- **Debugging**: Use `fgcli.py -t config.yaml pp` to examine preprocessed output

## Current Understanding of Codebase

### Trainer Hierarchy
- `ExtensibleTrainer` (interface) → `BaseTrainer` (abstract) → `SimpleTrainer`/`AccelTrainer`/`PipelineTrainer`
- Training flow: `_prepare()` → `_train_loop()` with checkpoint integration
- Key files:
  - `src/forgather/ml/base_trainer.py` - Core checkpoint functionality
  - `src/forgather/ml/trainer.py` - Main trainer implementation
  - `src/forgather/ml/trainer_types.py` - Configuration classes

### Checkpoint System (Recently Implemented)
- **State Persistence**: Saves optimizer state, LR scheduler state, global step, model weights
- **Discovery**: Uses modification time for robust checkpoint finding
- **Configuration**: `save_optimizer_state`, `save_scheduler_state`, `restore_*_state`, `resume_from_checkpoint`
- **Integration**: Checkpoint restoration happens in `_prepare()` after state initialization

### Common Debugging Patterns
1. **Template Issues**: Check inheritance chain, use `fgcli.py pp` to see final config
2. **Checkpoint Problems**: Verify training_state.pt exists, check device handling
3. **Configuration Override**: Create separate trainer config sections to bypass inheritance

## Recent Work Completed

### Checkpoint Functionality Implementation
- Fixed "'int' object is not callable" error by using `torch.device()` properly
- Added model weight loading using `sharded_checkpoint.load_checkpoint()`
- Implemented global step restoration for proper training continuation
- Created comprehensive test project in `examples/tiny_experiments/checkpointing/`

### Files Modified
- `base_trainer.py`: Added `_save_training_state()`, `_load_training_state()`, `_load_model_from_checkpoint()`
- `trainer.py`: Integrated checkpoint restoration into training flow
- `trainer_types.py`: Added checkpoint configuration options
- Created complete example project with working notebook

## Effective Interaction Patterns

### What Works Well
- Direct, specific requests with context about the goal
- Asking for debugging help with error messages and relevant code
- Requesting explanation of unfamiliar architectural patterns
- Collaborative problem-solving with technical feedback

### Project Navigation
- Use `Glob` and `Grep` tools for finding files and patterns
- Use `Read` to examine specific files once located
- Use `Task` tool for complex searches requiring multiple steps
- Always check `git status` before making changes

### Code Modification Approach
- Read existing code first to understand patterns and conventions
- Follow existing architectural patterns rather than introducing new ones
- Test changes incrementally when possible
- Use proper error handling and logging

## Current Project Status
- Checkpoint functionality fully implemented and tested
- Example project demonstrates complete save/resume cycle
- All changes committed to git repository
- No known outstanding issues with checkpoint system

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Template inheritance debugging often requires examining the full chain
- The `fgcli.py pp` command is invaluable for configuration debugging
- Device handling in PyTorch requires `torch.device()` objects, not strings
- Checkpoint restoration timing is critical - must happen after state initialization

## Useful Commands
```bash
# Debug configuration preprocessing
fgcli.py -t config.yaml pp

# Run training with proper environment
RANK=0 python scripts/train_script.py config.yaml

# Check project structure
ls examples/tiny_experiments/checkpointing/
```
