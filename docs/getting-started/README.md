# Getting Started with Forgather

Welcome to Forgather! This section will get you up and running quickly with the framework.

## Quick Links

- **[Installation](installation.md)** - Install Forgather and dependencies
- **[Quickstart](quickstart.md)** - 15-minute tutorial to train your first model
- **[First Project](first-project.md)** - Create and understand a complete project

## What is Forgather?

Forgather is a configuration-driven ML framework that makes it easy to:

- **Experiment systematically** with template-based configurations
- **Scale training** from single GPU to distributed setups
- **Maintain reproducibility** through complete configuration tracking
- **Migrate from HuggingFace** with minimal code changes

## Learning Path

### 1. Installation (5 minutes)
```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 2. Quick Tutorial (15 minutes)
Run through the [quickstart tutorial](quickstart.md) to train a small model and understand the basics.

### 3. First Project (30 minutes)
Follow the [first project guide](first-project.md) to create a complete training project from scratch.

### 4. Core Concepts (15 minutes)
Read about [core concepts](../core-concepts/) to understand projects, templates, and configuration.

### 5. Explore Examples
Browse [examples](../examples/) for common patterns and use cases.

## Prerequisites

- **Python**: 3.8+ (3.10+ recommended)
- **PyTorch**: 1.12+ (latest stable recommended)
- **CUDA**: Optional, for GPU training
- **Git**: For cloning examples and managing projects

## Next Steps

After getting started:

1. **[Trainers](../trainers/)** - Learn about the training system
2. **[Configuration](../configuration/)** - Master the template system
3. **[Models](../models/)** - Understand model construction
4. **[Guides](../guides/)** - Best practices and optimization
